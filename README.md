# MemoryGame
A simple memorization game

Press any key to start the game. It will begin by flashing the first tile to click. Once clicked, it will flash another. All previous tiles must be clicked in order to proceed!

For example, if the game flashes green, you click green. If the game then flashes yellow, you click green, then click yellow. If red flashes next, you must click green, yellow, then red.

How far can you get?
